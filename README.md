# Welcome to our GitHub!

# Introduction
We are team 6Nuts3Bolts, a dynamic trio of passionate robotics enthusiasts. 
Based off of the nature of the task, we divded the industry and each took on a key aspect of the challenge.

# Our Engineering Process
It is vilat to understand a problem and its features in depth before planning and undertaking its solution. Hence, we first spent a day analysing the challenge in depth and noting down a few principles, parameters, fundamental ideas off of which we could organize our thinking and streamline our ideation process to efficiently solve the challenge. 
Here are the principles we decided on:

**Design and Construction**
- Simplicity and practicality, a design appropriate for the challenge, not overly complex
- Modular, easy to assemble and disassemble
- 

**Electrical Systems**
- f
- f
- f

**Logic and Programming**
- f
- f
- f

Based off these fundamental ideas, we aimed to conceptualize our entire robot 

Next, we immediately begain the prototyping and iteration process.
