# Our Engineering Process
It is vital to understand a problem and its features in depth before planning and undertaking its solution. Hence, we first spent a day analysing the challenge in depth and noting down a few principles, parameters, fundamental ideas off of which we could organize our thinking and streamline our ideation process to efficiently solve the challenge. 
Here are the principles we decided on:

**Design and Construction**
- Compact, able to maneuver past obstacles even at high speeds
- Simple and practical, a design appropriate for the challenge, not overly complex
- Modular, quick and easy to assemble and disassemble
- 

**Electrical Systems**
- Clean and orgranised, connections easy to keep track of
- Reliable and safe, eliminate any chances of a short or circuit failure
- Easy to assemble and dissassemble
### Electrical Components list:
- RaspberryPi 4B
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 with Wide Angle Lens
- Arduino Nano
- BNO055 IMU
- MG995 Servo
- RevRobotics NEO550
- RevRobotics SparkMax Motor Controller
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- Xcluma USB Buck Converter()
- Switch
- Pushbutton
- Barrier Block Screw Terminals
- General Purpose Board
- JST Connectors
- Jumper Wires
- XT60 Connectors
- Crimp Connectors

Based off these fundamental ideas, we aimed to conceptualize our robot.
Next, we immediately begain the prototyping and iteration process.
